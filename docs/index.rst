Welcome

When a city councilor is considering an issue, they need to know what other
cities are doing about it, so they can make informed decisions.

city-struggle-bus is a custom search engine for local governance issues.

It combines:

* `Scrapy`_ for crawling
* `Django`_ for web interface
* `Elasticsearch`_ for indexing and searching

.. _Scrapy: http://scrapy.org/
.. _Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/
.. _Elasticsearch: https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch
